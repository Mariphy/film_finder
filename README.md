# Film Finder Project

## Description
*This is a Codecademy project on introductory back-end. Aimed at training async GET requests and using APIs. The files for the project were prepared by the Codecademy team. I worked in the script.js file to complete this project.*

"You’ve caught up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look. In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion." 



## How to use
You'll need to add your own api key for the program to run.
